# Cozmo Programming with Blockly - Examples

An `afraid-but-follow` example is available as XML and executes the following:
- sets two cubes as Minecraft mods - one zombie and one spiderman
- Cozmo will follow spiderman when spiderman gets farther than 15 cm
- Cozmo will get `startled` when zombie gets closer than 20 cm

By moving cubes closer and farther aways you can make Cozmo react on them. At the same time you can see all objects rendered in 3D scene.

To try this example copy `afraid-but-follow.xml` to `server/saves/` folder and click the `load/folder` button - you'll see it in the list to open.
